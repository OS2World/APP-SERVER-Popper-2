Popper/2
PostOffice3 server/2 (C)vik@avi.kiev.ua 96-99

Little pop3 server for os/2. tested with uupc/2
You need to put _uncripted_ passwords in the second field of passwd file.
You need tcp/ip installed.
You need emx runtime installed.

How to install:
Just unzip it, add passwords in your passwd file and run.
---passwd sample---
root::::Superuser:c:\uupc\usr\root:
    ^^Add your password here :
root:toor:::Superuser:c:\uupc\usr\root:
---end of passwd sample---


Command line:
popper <directory where maildrops are kept> <passwd file>
If you have uupc installed at c:\uupc:
popper c:\uupc\mail\boxes c:\uupc\conf\passwd
